# Vehicle Image Classification App

## 1. Project Overview
This project classifies vehicle images into **7 classes** using **EfficientNetB0** and **Streamlit**.

The app allows users to upload a vehicle image and returns:
- Predicted class
- Confidence score
- Class probability chart

---

## 2. Classes
The model predicts the following 7 vehicle classes:

- Auto Rickshaws
- Bikes
- Cars
- Motorcycles
- Planes
- Ships
- Trains

---

## 3. Model Performance
- **Test Accuracy:** 98.34%
- **Test Loss:** 0.0895

> *(Update these values if your final notebook shows slightly different results.)*

## 4. Project Files
- `app.py` → Streamlit app code
- `requirements.txt` → Required Python libraries
- `class_names.json` → Class labels used by the model
- `README.md` → Project documentation

> The trained model file (`vehicle_classifier_best.h5`) is hosted on **Google Drive** because GitHub file upload size is limited.
